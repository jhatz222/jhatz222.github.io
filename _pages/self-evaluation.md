Below is my reflection on how this portfolio demonstrates the course outcomes:

| Outcome                  | Evidence in Portfolio                                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Outcome 1: Software Design** | Repository & DAO patterns; modular code snippets           |
| **Outcome 2: Algorithms**      | Custom Binary Search Tree implementation & MongoDB aggregation benchmarks |
| **Outcome 3: Performance**     | Measured sort vs Binary Search Tree; indexed Room queries                  |
| **Outcome 4: Data Management** | Room entities; MongoDB indexes                              |
| **Outcome 5: Usability**       | Opt-in live comments; clear narratives                      |

> **Overall Reflection:**  
> This portfolio collects my three major capstone enhancements: real-time dashboards, data-structure benchmarks, and persistent storage—each aligned to core course outcomes.  It shows not only *what* I built, but *why* and *how* I met the key learning objectives.
