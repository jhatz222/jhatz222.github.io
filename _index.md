# Welcome!

Welcome to my capstone ePortfolio.  
Use the menu above to explore my enhancements in:

- [Software Design & Engineering](/software-design)
- [Algorithms & Data Structures](/algorithms-data-structures)
- [Databases](/databases)

Feel free to click through each section for code samples, narratives, and reflections!

You can also include a short introduction paragraph here about your professional journey, links to your GitHub repo, or anything else you’d like people to see right away.
