# Welcome!

Welcome to my capstone ePortfolio. In this ePortfolio, I have taken three projects that were originally put together in prior classes and enhanced them to show proficiency in Software Design & Engineering, Databases, and Algorithms & Data Structures.

Below, you will first find a Code Review, where I review the code of these three projects and outline my proposed enhancements to them.

Next, I have outlined the name of the projects that I used to showcase proficiency in each topic and linked to the GitHub folder that houses the original code folder, the updated code folder, and the project narrative detailing the enhancements.

Feel free t with this Home page and then click on one of the links at the bottom to take you through the individual pages detailing these enhancements. Or, you can click on the Nav Bar at the top to cycle through these pages.
